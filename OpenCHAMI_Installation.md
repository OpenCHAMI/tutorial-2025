# Install OpenCHAMI Services

There are several ways to install and activate OpenCHAMI on a head node.  For this tutorial, we will use the signed RPM from the [openchami/release](https://github.com/openchami/release) repository.  This RPM mainly exists to hold systemd unit filed which run containers as podman quadlets.  As part of the installation, the RPM pulls all the OpenCHAMI containers from the github container registry.  The RPM itself is signed and each container is attested publicly through Sigstore tooling integrated by GitHub.  You can read more about the attestation process in the [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).

To make things easier for the tutorial, we have created a [bash script](https://gist.github.com/alexlovelltroy/96bfc8bb6f59c0845617a0dc659871de) that:

1. identifies the latest release rpm
1. downloads the public signing key for OpenCHAMI
1. downloads the rpm
1. verifies the signature
1. installs the RPM

## Install Command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/alexlovelltroy/96bfc8bb6f59c0845617a0dc659871de/raw | bash
```

## Review Installed Containers

The post-install script for the RPM pulls all the official containers from the github container registry and stores them for use later.  You can review them with `podman`.

```bash
sudo podman images
```

## Initialize and Trust the OpenCHAMI Certificate Auhority

OpenCHAMI includes a minimal open source certificate authority from smallstep.  The included automation initialized the CA on first startup.  We can immediately download a certificate into the system trust bundle on the host for trusting all subsequent OpenCHAMI certificates.  Notably, the certificate authority features ACME for automatic certificate rotation.

Start the certificate authority:

```bash
sudo systemctl start step-ca
sudo systemctl status step-ca
```

Import the root certificate into the system trust bundle:

```bash
sudo podman run --rm --network openchami-cert-internal docker.io/curlimages/curl -sk https://step-ca:9000/roots.pem | sudo tee /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ochami.pem
sudo update-ca-trust
```

## Start OpenCHAMI

Even OpenCHAMI runs as a collection of containers. Podman's integration with systemd allows us to start, stop, and trace OpenCHAMI as a set of dependent services through the `openchami.target` unit.

```bash
sudo systemctl start openchami.target
systemctl list-dependencies openchami.target
```

### Service Configuration

The OpenCHAMI release rpm is created with sensible default configurations for this tutorial and all configuration files are included in the `/etc/openchami` directory.  To understand each one in detail, review the (service_configuration)[service_configuration.md] instructions

## Install and Configure OpenCHAMI Client

The [`ochami` CLI](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/ochami) provides us an easy way to interact with the OpenCHAMI services.

### Installation

We can install the latest RPM with the following:

```bash
latest_release_url=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/OpenCHAMI/ochami/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | endswith("amd64.rpm")) | .browser_download_url')
curl -L "${latest_release_url}" -o ochami.rpm
sudo dnf install ./ochami.rpm
```

As a sanity check, check the version to make sure it is installed properly:

```bash
ochami version
```

The output should look something like:

```
Version:    0.2.1
Tag:        v0.2.1
Branch:     HEAD
Commit:     3b28490f9a9a84070533d6794a1e5442a0c43dff
Git State:  clean
Date:       2025-04-08T18:18:34Z
Go:         go1.24.2
Compiler:   gc
Build Host: fv-az1333-80
Build User: runner
```

### Configuration

To configure `ochami` to be able to communicate with our cluster, we need to create a config file. We can create one in one fell swoop with:

```bash
ochami config cluster set --user --default demo cluster.uri https://demo.openchami.cluster:8443
```

This will create a config file at `~/.config/ochami/config.yaml`. We can check that `ochami` is reading it properly with:

```bash
ochami config show
```

We should see:

```yaml
clusters:
    - cluster:
        uri: https://demo.openchami.cluster:8443
      name: demo
default-cluster: demo
log:
    format: rfc3339
    level: warning
```

Now we should be able to communicate with our cluster. Let's make sure by checking the status of one of the services:

```bash
ochami bss status
```

We should get:

```json
{"bss-status":"running"}
```

Voil√†!
